# Installation
Just simply copy and paste the proxgfy.php and proxgfy folder into your inc/plugins folder.
Once you've done that, you can then head to your ACP and enable the ProxGFY plugin.

# Requirements
The ProxGFY plugin requires a minimum PHP version of 5.4 (PHP version 7.0+ recommended) and
any MyBB version (though the latest version is recommended).
