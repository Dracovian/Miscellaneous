Expected Release Date: January 14, 2020

This guide is currently incomplete and will be incomplete
for at least another 6 months.

January 14, 2020 will mark the end of extended support for
Windows 7 users and this guide should assist with the
switch from Windows 7 to Linux for those who aren't going
to upgrade to Windows 10 anytime soon.

This guide will focus on a few things including:
	- Introduction to computing
	- Introduction to Linux
	- Troubleshooting Linux
	- Linux recommendations
	- Tweaking Linux performance
	- Tweaking Linux security
	- Tweaking Linux appearance
	
Among other subject matters pertaining to Linux for those
who have no prior knowledge of the Linux operating system.

There will be a heavy emphasis on images for this guide so
expect there to be pages dedicated to the images. Currently
there is only a single image that will serve as a simple
placeholder image for a reference point.
