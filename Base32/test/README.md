## What is this area? ##

This area was used by me to run the tests on my machine.

**The compiler used for this test is Tiny C Compiler for Windows platforms*

## Machine specs ##

```
CPU: Intel Core i5-4690K @ 4.00GHz
RAM: 1x8GB DDR3-1600MHz
HDD: 1x1TB SATA-3 6.0Gbps @ 7200RPM
 OS: Windows 7 Ultimate x64
 CC: Tiny C Compiler - 0.9.27
```

## Results from 100,000 words ##

```
Start Time:  02:25:48.02
Ending Time: 02:27:23.73
Total Time:  00:01:35.71
```

If we were to call the act of encoding and decoding each word a "cycle" then that would translate to roughly 1044 cycles per second.

***These results will differ based on the operating system, hardware, and compiler used to compile this program.***

## Let me know how it ran on your system ##

We're bound to be using different hardware, operating systems, and compilers.

So if you're wanting to share your benchmark results for comparison-sake *(or for bragging rights)* then feel free to open up an issue with the following format:

```

RAM: (#)x(#)(MB/GB/TB) DDR(#)-(#)MHz
HDD: (#)x(#)(MB/GB/TB) SATA-(#) (#.0)Gbps @ (#)RPM
 OS: (Windows/Linux/MacOS) (Version) (Architecture)
 CC: (Compiler) - (Version)
 
Start Time:  (HH):(MM):(SS.SS)
Ending Time: (HH):(MM):(SS.SS)
