## Guidebook Template

This portion of the Guidebook Template is reserved
for any images.

To use the images you must ensure that the imagex
package is in use.

This is how we add our images:
\includegraphics[args]{Images/Filename}

Do not include the file extension since LaTeX only
really supports a handful of formats for images.
